.. Crafting a Interpreter in C++ documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Thu Nov 14 10:29:46 2019.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

   notes from dan 

   I had to copy the breadcrumbs template into the _template folder and modify \
   the template to get the Docs text to become the home icon (in github repo this \
   has been done in a hopefullly soonto be released 0.4.4 sphinx_rtd_theme)

This book would not have been possible without Bob Nystrom's Crafting Interepreters. This book \
can be seen a seen as a companion piece to it to show how a similar implementation can be made \
using c++.
